First debuting on the basketball court in 1982, the Air Force 1 quickly became a staple of the streets where it’s remained ever since. When sneaker technology progressed and the Air Force 1 was no longer commonly found on the court, it was then adopted by the sneaker fanatics and hip-hop kids in New York City in the mid ’80s. Since then, it’s gone on to be one of the most worn shoes ever, with millions of pairs sold worldwide. With its clean, simple – yet bold – look, the amazingly comfortable Air Force 1has become a true classic. If you don’t have a pair of Air Force 1’s, can you really even call yourself a sneakerhead? The Air Force 1 Low is most iconic in its simple white-on-white leather colorway, but the shoe has been produced in thousands of other color combinations, materials, and special edition modifications throughout its long and illustrious life.

                        new { ShoeId = 4, Description = "Since its original release in 1987, the Reebok Workout Plus has never gone out of style. The trainer has earned a committed UK fan base that loves the shoe in a comparable way to the U.S. market’s love for Air Jordan retros. The timeless feel of Reebok Classics allows the Workout Plus to look fantastic in any decade on any continent. A shoe that was ahead of its time, the Workout Plus’s designers sought to create a shoe capable of holding up to the rigors of cross training. They aimed for the ability to go straight from the weight room to a tennis court. This multi-sport functionality was possible because of Reebok’s patented “H-Strap” mid-foot unit. The H-Strap allowed wearers to tighten the strap for improved lateral movement or loosen the strap for a more traditional running shoe feel. Reebok would continue to expand their cross-training line to include other classics like the Ventilator and Graphlite Pro. Currently, Reebok is the leader in cross-training footwear. Choosing to grow with the rise of multi-exercise competitions, Reebok began sponsoring various Crossfit competitions and acting as their exclusive outfitter. They’ve devoted an entire line exclusively to Crossfit with fantastic shoes like the Crossfit Nano 8 and the Crossfit Nano 2.0, which can be traced back to the Workout Plus. The Workout Plus is known for its ultra-premium, soft, full-grain leather and classic Reebok UK flag branding. There’s something inherently fresh about the design of this low-top OG trainer. Don’t be fooled though, the Workout Plus has plenty of substance, with an EVA foam midsole for shock absorption and added comfort. A sturdy, high-abrasion rubber outsole secures every step. In recent years, Reebok has remixed the Workout Plus for a new generation with collaborations with hot rappers like Lil Yachty and Lil Baby under their “Alter The Icons” initiative. The Alter The Icons line strives to promote individual uniqueness.
